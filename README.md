Redbearded Bluhat Guys
======================

This game was created by the team of 3 students during the programming contest Spring GameDev Half-marathon which took place at the Faculty of Information Technology at Brno University of Technology.

Our game called Redbearded Bluehat Guys can be classified as a "Survival platformer". It introduces a young hero equipped with a mere slingshot surrounded by the loads of angry enemies continuously growing in number. Try to survive the attack and achieve the highscore!
